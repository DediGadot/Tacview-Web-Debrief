# Enhanced Pilot and Group Naming Fix for Debrief-Only Uploads

## Problem Identified

When uploading only a `debrief.log` file (without `dcs.log`), the system was generating generic pilot names like `F-16C_50_16779008` and basic group names like `Blue F-16C_50 Squadron`. This provided poor user experience compared to uploads with both files.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was that in debrief-only mode, the system wasn't extracting meaningful information from the debrief file itself. The debrief file contains:

1. **Global callsign**: `callsign = "New callsign"` - The human player's callsign
2. **World state section**: Contains unit information with `unitId`, `groupId`, `type`, `coalition`
3. **Mission file path**: Contains the mission name for better group naming

However, the original system only used basic aircraft type + object ID naming without leveraging this rich information.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced World State Extraction

Added `extract_world_state_info()` method to parse the debrief file and extract:
- **Global callsign** from the file header
- **Mission name** from the mission file path
- **Unit information** from the world_state section (unitId, groupId, type, coalition)

**Key Challenge**: The world_state format uses multi-line structures:
```lua
[1] = 
{
    alt = 301.85354614258,
    type = "F-16C_50",
    groupId = 2,
    coalition = "blue",
    unitId = 2,
    ...
}
```

**Solution**: Implemented line-by-line parsing with brace counting to properly extract unit blocks.

### 2. Enhanced Pilot Naming Logic

Added `create_enhanced_pilot_names()` method that:

#### For Units in World State:
- **Human player**: Uses global callsign (e.g., "New callsign")
- **AI pilots**: Uses flight position naming (e.g., "Blue F-16C_50 Two", "Blue F-16C_50 Three")
- **Single pilot groups**: Uses descriptive names (e.g., "Blue F-16C_50 Pilot")

#### For Units Not in World State:
- **Fallback groups**: Creates standard squadron names (e.g., "Red F-15C Squadron")
- **Maintains original naming**: For units that spawn dynamically or aren't in initial state

### 3. Enhanced Group Naming

Groups now use meaningful names based on context:
- **Single group missions**: `"{Coalition} {Aircraft} - {Mission Name}"` (e.g., "Blue F-16C_50 - test-unit-group-script")
- **Multi-group missions**: `"{Coalition} {Aircraft} Squadron {GroupId}"` (e.g., "Blue F-16C_50 Squadron 2")
- **Fallback groups**: `"{Coalition} {Aircraft} Squadron"` (e.g., "Red F-15C Squadron")

### 4. Pilot Assignment Logic

The system now:
1. **Processes world_state units first** - Creates enhanced names for units with full information
2. **Handles unassigned pilots** - Creates fallback groups for units not in world_state
3. **Maintains relationships** - Updates kill/death relationships to use enhanced names
4. **Prevents double assignment** - Tracks assigned pilots to avoid conflicts

## Technical Implementation Details

### Modified Methods in `dcs_mission_analyzer.py`:

1. **`extract_world_state_info()`**: Parses debrief file for enhanced information
2. **`create_enhanced_pilot_names()`**: Creates meaningful pilot and group names
3. **`create_synthetic_groups()`**: Updated to use enhanced naming when available

### Key Features:

- **Robust parsing**: Handles complex nested Lua structures in world_state
- **Fallback support**: Gracefully handles units not in world_state
- **Human player detection**: Automatically identifies and names human player
- **Flight position naming**: Uses military-style position names (Lead, Two, Three, Four)
- **Mission-based naming**: Incorporates mission name for better context

## Results

### Before Fix:
```
Pilots:
- F-16C_50_16779008 (F-16C_50) - Group: Blue F-16C_50 Squadron (ID: 1)
- F-16C_50_16779264 (F-16C_50) - Group: Blue F-16C_50 Squadron (ID: 1)
- F-16C_50_16779520 (F-16C_50) - Group: Blue F-16C_50 Squadron (ID: 1)
- F-16C_50_16779776 (F-16C_50) - Group: Blue F-16C_50 Squadron (ID: 1)
- F-15C_16778496 (F-15C) - Group: Red F-15C Squadron (ID: 2)
- F-15C_16778752 (F-15C) - Group: Red F-15C Squadron (ID: 2)

Groups:
- Blue F-16C_50 Squadron (4 pilots)
- Red F-15C Squadron (2 pilots)
```

### After Fix:
```
Pilots:
- New callsign (F-16C_50) - Group: Blue F-16C_50 - test-unit-group-script (ID: 1)
- Blue F-16C_50 Two (F-16C_50) - Group: Blue F-16C_50 - test-unit-group-script (ID: 1)
- Blue F-16C_50 Three (F-16C_50) - Group: Blue F-16C_50 - test-unit-group-script (ID: 1)
- Blue F-16C_50 Four (F-16C_50) - Group: Blue F-16C_50 - test-unit-group-script (ID: 1)
- F-15C_16778496 (F-15C) - Group: Red F-15C Squadron (ID: 2)
- F-15C_16778752 (F-15C) - Group: Red F-15C Squadron (ID: 2)

Groups:
- Blue F-16C_50 - test-unit-group-script (4 pilots)
- Red F-15C Squadron (2 pilots)
```

## Key Improvements

1. ✅ **Human player identification**: "New callsign" instead of generic ID
2. ✅ **Flight position naming**: "Blue F-16C_50 Two" instead of object IDs
3. ✅ **Mission-based group names**: Incorporates actual mission name
4. ✅ **Maintains compatibility**: Fallback naming for edge cases
5. ✅ **Preserves relationships**: Kill/death tracking uses enhanced names
6. ✅ **Dashboard compatibility**: All existing functionality works with enhanced names

## Testing

Tested with `debrief-3.log` which contains:
- 4 F-16C_50 units in world_state (Blue coalition, groupId 2)
- 2 F-15C units not in world_state (Red coalition, spawned dynamically)
- Global callsign: "New callsign"
- Mission: "test-unit-group-script"

All tests pass and the enhanced naming works correctly in both direct analysis and web application flow.

## Backward Compatibility

The fix is fully backward compatible:
- **With DCS.log**: Uses existing XML-based naming (no change)
- **Without DCS.log**: Uses enhanced naming from debrief file
- **Fallback**: If world_state parsing fails, uses original synthetic naming
- **Edge cases**: Handles units not in world_state gracefully

This enhancement significantly improves the user experience for debrief-only uploads while maintaining all existing functionality.
